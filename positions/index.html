        <h4>We are now inviting <strong>postdocs</strong>, <strong>doctoral</strong> and <strong>master students</strong> to our lab! Please check the details below. </h4>


        <h3>The work of our lab</h3>
        <p>
          As a robotics group, we strive to design assistant robots that extend human capability through intuitive and immersive human-robot interfaces.
          For this goal, we are using interdisciplinary scientific and engineering techniques, from hardware design to human factor experiment, based on robotics.
          Therefore, the research background includes but not limited to: robotics, mechatronics, mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, neuroscience or related field.
        </p>

        <h3>The requirements to join our lab</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Passion and self-motivation as sharing our vision are the most important requirements to work with us.
            Although grade on the transcription is the most noticeable criteria, we equally count other factors such as language skill, industry experience, different research field’s work, or other positive and passionate experiences would be taken
            into account to evaluate these.
            We know that grade is not everything to assess one’s potential on the research.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific technical backgrounds are strongly recommended, since robotics field requires versatile abilities in many different areas. Skill such as programming, data analysis, statistics, mechanical design, or interaction design can be an
            example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ambitious goal as a professional researcher is strongly recommended.
            Whatever positions that you’re thinking about, we will not waste your time.
            We aim high; competing and discussing with professionals in all over the world.
            This will be hard to achieve, but we believe it is worth to passionately devote some years of our life.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            We are currently working with <a href="http://rnb.postech.ac.kr">Robotics Laboratory, POSTECH</a>, as sharing laboratory, resources, projects and discussion.
            Since robotics includes various research themes in detail, we believe this environment offers nutritious background for the research.
          </li>
          <li>
            We currently set our working hour as from 10 AM to 8 PM; however, working from 10 AM to 10 PM is recommended.
