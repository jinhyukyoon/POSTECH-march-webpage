        <h4>We are now inviting <strong>postdocs</strong>, <strong>doctoral</strong> and <strong>master students</strong> to our lab. Please check the details below. </h4>


        <h3>What does your lab do?</h3>
        <p>
          As a robotics group, we endeavor to design assistant robots that extend human capability through intuitive and immersive human-robot interfaces.
          For this goal, we use interdisciplinary scientific and engineering techniques, from hardware design to human factor experiment, based on robotics.
          Therefore, the research background includes but not limited to: robotics, mechatronics, mechanical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, neuroscience or related field.
          Research topics that currently working on are following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Prediction of human motion intention based on surface-myoelectric(sEMG) sensor
            </li>
            <li>
              High-precision teleoperative surgical robotics for electrode insertion on peripheral nerves
            </li>
            <li>
              Prosthetic hand design and clinical trial for partial hand amputee
            </li>
            <li>
              Finger wearable haptic device
            </li>
            <li>
              Exoskeleton robotics for the wrist rehabilitation
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="padding"></div>
        <h3>What qualifications do I need?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Passion and self-motivation to become an expert are the most important requirements to work with us.
            Although grade on the transcription is the most noticeable criteria for this, we equally count other factors such as language skill, industry experience, work on different research field, or other positive and passionate experiences.
            We know that grade is not everything to assess one’s potential on the research.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific technical backgrounds are strongly recommended, since robotics field requires versatile abilities in many different areas. Skill such as programming, data analysis, statistics, mechanical design, or interaction design can be an
            example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ambitious goal as a professional researcher is strongly recommended.
            Whatever positions that you’re thinking about, we will not waste your time.
            We aim high; competing and discussing with outstanding professionals in all over the world.
            Even this will be hard to achieve, we believe it is worth to passionately devote several years of our life.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="padding"></div>
        <h3>What are the conditions of your lab?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Currently, there is no slot limitation to accept future members.</strong>
            Any people who satisfy above requirements can join us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://admission.postech.ac.kr" target="_blank">Our university</a> basically provides financial supports on tuition and living expenses.
            Furthermore, as long as proceeding projects related to fund of our lab are available, we try to provide additional and reasonable financial support.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are currently working with <a href="http://rnb.postech.ac.kr" target="_blank">Robotics Laboratory, POSTECH</a>, as sharing laboratory, resources, projects and discussion.
            Since robotics includes various research themes in detail, we believe this environment offers nutritious background for the research.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="padding"></div>
        <h3>Should I have to participate an internship to join you?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Internship for prospective graduate students is recommended, but we cannot be sure of its slot due to varying conditions of our physical and human resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For now, we do not have any available slots for the internship on 2020 spring.
              Internship on 2020 summer will be announced later.</strong>
            <!--If you're interested in getting an internship, please contact us as below.-->
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're a POSTECH student, you can apply the internship with Research Participation (MECH399).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're not a POSTECH student, please contact us to arrange your schedule. Usually summer or winter session internship would be available.
          </li>
        </ul>
